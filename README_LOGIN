== Installation

Done generating the login system. but there are still a few things you have to do 
manually. First open your application.rb and add 

  require_dependency "login_system"

to the top of the file and include the login system with 

  include LoginSystem 

The beginning of your ApplicationController.
It should look something like this : 

  require_dependency "login_system"

  class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
    include LoginSystem


After you have done the modifications the the AbstractController you can 
import the user model into the database. This model is meant as an example 
and you should extend it. If you just want to get things up and running you
can find some create table syntax in db/user_model.sql. 

== Useage 

Now you can go around and happily add "before_filter :login_required" to the controllers which you would like to protect. 
If the user hits a controller with the login_required filter he will be redirected to the login page and redirected back after a successful login. You can find the login_system.rb in the lib/ directory. It comes with some comments which should help explain the general useage.
