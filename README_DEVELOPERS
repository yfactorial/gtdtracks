1. SQLITE3 FOR TESTING

By default, tests are configured to run using sqlite3 in memory mode to increase speed. You will need the sqlite3-ruby gem for this.

To avoid showing the migrations as tests are run, add the following to your database.yml below 'database: ":memory:"':

  verbosity: quiet

If you want to run tests using another database, that's fine, too. Just change your database.yml accordingly.

2. SELENIUM TESTS

To run selenium tests, start Tracks in test mode using

  script/server -e test
 
Then open a browser to

  http://localhost:3000/selenium/
  
and interact with the test runner.
