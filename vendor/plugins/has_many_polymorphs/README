Self-referential, polymorphic has_many :through helper

Copyright 2006 Evan Weaver (see the LICENSE file)

"model :parent_class" may be required in some controllers or perhaps models in order for reloading to work properly, since the parent setup must be executed on the child every time the child class is reloaded.

Also see the source code, although it's probably not going to be super helpful to you.
